# Cook at home 

Welcome to my project! This is Single Page Application, based on ReactJS and Node.js. 
I started this project with the main motivation to develop and deepen my knowledge not just in the ReactJS framework, but CSS and HTML as well.

The project was created through the course [ReactJS](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3973/reactjs-february-2023) at the [Software University]() and it is intetended to be defended as part of succesfully pass of the course. 

The App represents a cooking web site, where users have functionalities such as :
  - create own recipes
  - add to favorites
  - add products to shopping list
  - store recipe images to Cloudinary
  
and others.
